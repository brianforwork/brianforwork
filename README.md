👋 Hey there! I’m Brian, a passionate software engineer with a love for Cloud Computing and Web Development.

💞️ I’m eager to collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of software engineering, especially those in fashion tech or sports analytics. If you’re working on something cool in these areas, let’s connect!
